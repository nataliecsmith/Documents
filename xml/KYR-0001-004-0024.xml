<p>Much personal ill feeling certainly Existed against the petitioner Nancy Allan which was clearly manifested by the witesses for the Comlth, Judging from facts. which have been made Known to me since the trial, are upon which I can rely:- I respectfully, suggest that Executive clemency will have been, justly bestowed if the fine <hi rend="str">were</hi> be remitted</p>

<p>From the facts stated above by Mr Reasor from his personal Knowledge I think the Executive clemency would be properly <unclear/> bestowed by remitting the fine</p>
