<lb/>States that he was the only attorney Deft wood had employed and that he wood had no friend or relations who paid any attention to the preparation of his case and believes that he did not have a fair chance on account of having friends to procure the attendance of his witnesses Deft being in jail and having no chance himself to get them</p>
