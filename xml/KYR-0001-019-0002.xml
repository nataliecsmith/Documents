<lb/>Gentlemen</p>
<p>Your very kind letter of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> inst tendering to me the services of your gallant regiment in the contingencies alluded to has awakened in me emotions of the liveliest sensibility and would have been sooner answered, but I was away from home. In declining to accept your generous offer I am deeply impressed with the patriotic motives which have induced it -- </p>
<p>In the tender you have made at a time like this, when the ties which have bound our Union together seem to be growing weaker and weaker every day, I fully appreciate and reciprocate the fraternal spirit in which it was done -- In such kind offices the friendship which should ever exist between the states of <placeName ref="cwgk:P001818">Indiana</placeName> and Kentucky will be kept actively alive, and should it ever become necessary (a thing I can scarcely imagine) for Kentucky to accept the Servi<hi rend="str">s</hi>ces of volunteers <hi rend="underline">outside</hi> of the state, there are none<pb/>
<lb/>She would more cordially accept or more readily receive than those of the gallant regiment you have the honor to command -- Thanking you for the offer, you have made I have the honor to be</p>
