   <p>The Petition of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000969">Montraville G Wilson</persName>, of the City of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00002504">Hickman, Fulton County, Kentucky</placeName>,
<lb/>Respectfully represents:</p>
   <p>That at the <date when="1861-05">May Term 1861</date> ^of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000380">Fulton Equity &amp; Criminal Court</orgName>,^ in company with <persName ref="cwgk:N00003111">John W Cole</persName>, and <persName ref="cwgk:N00003112">Thomas Wallace</persName>, he was indicted, tried and convicted for Gambling, contrary to the act of Assembly in such cases made and provided. That being so as aforesaid convicted, he, in company with the said Cole &amp; Wallace was sentenced to pay a fine of $20.00; but so it was, that through the interposition of the then Commwth's atty. the fine as against said Cole &amp; Wallace was remitted, but still remains as against your petitioner. Now your petitioner would respectfully further represent-- That the said prosecution was the result of anything but justice sought on the part of the prosecutor-- inasmuch as your petitioner is a hard working and as he conceives and believes in law abiding citizen, but upon the occasion referred to, being in company with the parties named, they entered into the game and for mere interest to the game, the stakes were made at five cents nor was there from the commencement to the end as much as five dollars in issue. Wherefore your petitioner humbly prays your Excellency to be pleased to remit said fine And as in duty bound he will ever pray &amp;c.</p>
