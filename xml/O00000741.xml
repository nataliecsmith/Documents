        <p>This department was created on August 17, 1861 and consisted of the departments of Washington, Northeastern Virginia, and the Shenandoah. This included Delaware, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and parts of eastern and northern Virginia. That part of Virginia west of the Blue Ridge Mountains was removed to the newly created Department of Western Virginia on September 19, 1861 and redefined on November 9, 1861 and January 23, 1862. The territory expanded on February 1, 1862 to include the states of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. A reconfiguration of those parts of Virginia existing in this department occurred on March 3, 1862. On March 22, 1862, the Middle Department was created removing New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, parts of Maryland, and the eastern shore of Virginia from this department. Most of the territories within this department were removed on April 2, 1862, and the Army of the Potomac began operations in the Department of Virginia through August 1862. The Army of the Potomac combined with the Army of Virginia on September 5, 1862. On September 19, 1862, the Army of the Potomac was an operational unit and controlled the territory in which it independently operated. With the exception of the Antietam and Gettysburg campaigns, the operations of the Army of the Potomac were confined to the state of Virginia. <hi rend=”italic”>Commander(s)</hi>: George B.
