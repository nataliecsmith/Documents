   <p>To His Excellency <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">J F Robinson</persName>
<lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>:</p>
   <p>As Magistrate in the <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000936">City of Covington</placeName> I tried the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky vs <persName ref="cwgk:N00000457">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Schmadde</persName> the driver or Agent of <persName ref="cwgk:N00000458">C. W. Roback</persName>, The proof showed that C. W. Roback had obtained a License <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>from the City of Covington and that the Defendant was his driver or Agent: this was proved by oral proof and by the License with an endorsement upon it. It also appeared that the License had issued to Mr Roback and not to the driver under the instructions of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00000961">Mayor of the City</persName> who issued it. As I<pb/>
<lb/>took the view that the License should have issued to the driver, I felt compelled to fi<hi rend="str">d</hi>ne the Defendant $50 and Costs. But as I am satisfied that the instructions of the Mayor led the Defendant into this difficulty, I believe it a case Justly claiming the Executive clemency, and Join in a prayer to have the fine remitted.</p>
