<lb/>Sir</p>
<p>I have been requested by the parties interested to state you the facts of a case, in which I understand application will be made to you for remission of a fine. At the <date when="--09">last Sept<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Term</date> of the Ballard circuit court a fine of Two Hundred Dollars was imposed on Jo<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caully &amp; W. Garrett for suffering gaming in their house in Blandsville. </p>
<p>It was prooen on the trial that parties had played cards in their house at which treats of liquor, cigars, oysters &amp;c were played for and paid for by the losers and that the proprietors s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> the M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caulley &amp; Garrett knew that said treats were played for- It was proven that the s<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> Garrett &amp; M<hi rend="sup">c</hi>Caulley allways forbid the<hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi> playing for money and would not allow it in their house -- I believe that the defendants <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>did not believe that they were violating the law, <hi rend="str">and</hi> They are poor men with families -- I believe they violated the law ignorantly -- </p>
