He states that knowing the circumstances the said Joseph Henin was induced to go upon the bail bond of the said DeGarris, for his appearance at the next circuit court. He states that said Dauson was reputed to have the said girl as his mistress, where De Garis was suspected of having become too intimate with her, said Dauson resorted to this mode of procedure Viz of informing on him, in order to get rid of him, and drive him, either out of the country or in jail. The petitioner knowing, this would be the ividence in the case, and knowing the prosecution would fall to the ground he was induced to go on the bail bond. <hi rend="str">This <unclear>was her</unclear></hi> The said De Garis being a millwright by profession, shortly after was induced to go to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001003">Memphis</placeName>, <hi rend="str">and</hi> where he was injured in his business, when the war broke out he was included, the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00003030">Confederate States</orgName>. He has not since then been able to find him. For ought he knows to the contrary he may have been killed long before judgment was taken on the forfeiture. When De Garis left here, he said he would<pb/>
    <lb/>without fail return and stand his trial. He states that last spring ^a year ago^ judgment having been rendered upon the bail bonds, he paid in same the sum of 30 per cent, the attorneys fee, and repleivd the remainder with <unclear>the</unclear> above named Chas Dupere as his surety. He states that on the <date when="1863-07-23">23 day of July, 1863</date>, two executions Nos 632, &amp; 633, were issued from the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000479">Nelson Circuit Court</orgName> ^one^ for $440.41 with a credit of $155,51 paid <date when="1862-05-31">31 May 1862</date> and the other for $524.84, at same date with credit of $169.84 paid <date when="1862-05-31">31 May 1862</date>. Which credits are the payments for the 30 per cent for Comths atty fee.</p>
<p>The state that they are poor men and if they are compelled to pay the above executions it will oppress them very much. The pray that you will interfere with your Executive clemency and remit the above forfeiture, and they will ever pray.</p>
