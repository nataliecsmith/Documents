    <lb/>Gov <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">T. E. Bramlett</persName>
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
   <p><persName ref="cwgk:N00002068">James Maloy</persName> arrested some months since for stealing 3 horses from this County, was indicted by the Grand Jury &amp; confined in Jail. In July he formed a conspiracy with several others to Break jail. He &amp; another prisoner named <persName ref="cwgk:N00002069">Barnes</persName>, since captured, &amp; convicted on a similar charge succeeded in making their escape under very agravating circumstances, for in my resisting their attemptd escape I was very badly injured myself<pb/>
<lb/>not however until I had succeeded in Killing one &amp; dangerously wounding another of the party. I offered a reward of &#36;50 for his arrest, which is as much as I can afford being a poor man.</p>
   <p>I now have information from the Marshal of <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000936">Covington</placeName> that if an additional reward of &#36;50 is offered he can be captured &amp; brought to justice.</p>
<p>Maloy is a notorious thief and is one of a gang who have been extensively engaged in Horse stealing in this region for months He should be made an example of &amp; I write to request you<pb/>
<lb/>to offer a reward of &#36;50 on the part of the state</p>
<p>Please answer by <hi rend="str">Telle</hi> Telligraph -- </p>
<p>Most Respectfully
