<lb/>Louisville Kentucky
<lb/>Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> Boyle</p>
<p>I address you from this place though my proper residence is in Trimble County Kentucky, You may have forgotten me, but perhaps one of your Aids who I think is named Hughes may remember me as the man who when you first Entered upon the discharge of the duties of Your office, Came to Louisville to See you in reference to the acts and doings of the Rebells in Trimble County Kentucky, Since then Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> I have had to flee from that county to Save my life, and living in Madison as a means of Safety to myself and family (My only offence being that I was for my Government) but before I was forced to leave the County I was Set upon by the Rebells day after day my life threatened, my family kept in Continual Dread and alarm, untill I finally did not Know what to do, I was poor living upon a small farm, prominent among the Rebells who were persecuting me and threathning my life was, one Thomas Maddox his threats were of such a character, that at last I believed that if Maddox could he would take my life,<pb/>
<lb/>and in a moment of phrenzy being driven to almost craziness by the rebells, I Sent Maddox a note to fight him a duel rather than have my life Sacrificed without having no chance for it, but all was of no avail, I had to flee from the county with family to Save them and Myself, but as soon as I wrote the note the Rebells took advantage of it and got up an Indictment against me in the Trimble Circuit Court and on the <date when="1863-10-08">8<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> day of this month</date> fined me five hundred Dollars, (without Even proving that the note was Ever delivered to Maddox) I was defended by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> S. E. DeHaven of LaGrange Oldham County Ky and M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Solon Russell the district Attorney here, but they had Determined that as the could not get my life they (the Rebells) would ruin me by having the fine imposed, and the little farm that I had to flee from sold to pay the <hi rend="str">farm &amp;c</hi> fine and now I am told that my little farm is Levied on by the Sheriff and will be sold to pay the fine, and I appeal to You Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> to see if you cannot get Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Bramlett to remit the <hi rend="str">fine</hi> fine or Else respite it untill I can have an oppertunity when our unfortunate troubles are over, to get up<pb/>
<lb/>the proof and Satisfy him that what I say is true, I am getting Somewhat in years and my little farm in Trimble is My all nearly, I have a wife and several small children to support, and Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> it looks hard to take my all for no other offense than that growing out of my loyalty to my Government, when goarded to desperation by a set of Rebells, intercede with ^the^ Gov<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> and try and save my little farm Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> and I will Ever remember you with gratitude</p>
<p>Respectfully Yours
<lb/>P Sheridan</p>
<p>I would think that it <hi rend="str">it</hi> would be a wise &amp; Just matter to have this Tho<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">s</hi></hi> Maddox arrested for Slandering ^the^ Government for the acts of its Preservation, also the Present Sheriff Elizah Rea </p>
<p>the Union Men of East Tennessee has not been more Prosecuted than the <hi rend="underline">few</hi> that are in Trimble Co. their affectation of Loyalty outwardly is only the Robe to Conceal their Disloyalty, Gen<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> do as you Please in this <hi rend="underline">matter</hi> but for Mercy Sake do not forget the above</p>
