   <p><placeName ref="cwgk:P00001936">Mt Sterling Ky</placeName>,, <date when="1863-08-27">Aug 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 1863</date>
<lb/>His Excellency
<lb/>Hon <persName ref="cwgk:N001004">J. F. Robinson</persName><lb/>Governor of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Ky</orgName>.</p>
<p>I address you in order to obtain the remission of a forfeiture of a recogniszance in a case where it would be a <hi rend="underline">great</hi> hardship for the men to pay it, or any portion of it. The two men liable are of the first standing in <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001937">Powel Co</placeName>. though not wealthy, and are Union men. As your Excellency is aware, you have the power of remitting the whole of the fine, including the District Atto<hi rend="sup">s,,</hi> share at any time before a Judgment upon the forfeiture (18 B. M. 512)</p>
<p>As the forfeiture is a heavy one the payment of the Atto<hi rend="sup">s,,</hi> share would be very oppressive, and unjust under the circumstances, though<pb/>
<lb/>the strict letter of the Law might forfeit it. At the last term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000491">Powel Circuit Court</orgName> the trial of the recognizance was continued till the next term. In order that your Excellency may understand the facts of the case I will make a statement of them in the form of an Affidavit. If other proof should be required it can easily be obtained.</p>
<p>Very Resply, <persName ref="cwgk:N00001939">W. Henry Holt</persName></p>
<p>The affiant, W. Henry Holt states that in the year <date when="1860">1860</date> an affray took place near <placeName ref="cwgk:P00001940">Stanton</placeName>, County of Powel, between two families, named respectively Bowen &amp; Hall.</p>
   <p>The cause of the affray was a land dispute &amp; the fathers of the families &amp; a number of the <persName ref="cwgk:N00001949">sons</persName> of each were engaged in it, as well as a man by the name of <persName ref="cwgk:N00001944">Wilbourn</persName>, now in the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">Union army</orgName>.</p>
   <p>One of <persName ref="cwgk:N00001942">Hall's</persName> <persName ref="cwgk:N00001949">sons</persName> was killed &amp; the<pb/>
    <lb/>Bowens (<persName ref="cwgk:N00001943">Father</persName> &amp; three sons) &amp; Wilbourne were indicted for manslaughter. A <hi rend="underline">Brother</hi> of the old man, Bowen, by the name of <persName ref="cwgk:N00002004">W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen</persName> &amp; a certain <persName ref="cwgk:N00002019">Mr Stone</persName>, rather than see the old man &amp; sons go to Jail, entered into a Recognizance for them &amp;. Wilbourn. The case was continued from time to time by the District Atto. the Bowens appearing <hi rend="underline">regularly</hi> at each Court since <date when="1860">1860</date>, and desiring a Trial. Last November term of the Court, however, the Bowens failed to enter their appearance though they were in the vicinity -- at home: and hence the Recognizance was forefeited. They started to come to the <date when="--11">November</date> Court &amp; <hi rend="underline">got</hi> <hi rend="underline">over</hi> <hi rend="underline">half</hi> <hi rend="underline">way</hi> to the Court House, when they were informed by a <hi rend="underline">number</hi> of <hi rend="underline">persons</hi>, that the Halls said they <hi rend="underline">would</hi> <hi rend="underline">shoot</hi> <hi rend="underline">them</hi> if they came to Court &amp; were prepared to do so. As they knew feeling ran high in regard to the matter, they did not<pb/>
 <lb/>dare to come farther &amp; turned about and went home. This was the reason why they did not appear- through no neglect of their own, or wish to avoid the Court's decrees. At the term of the Court just closed (<date when="--08">August</date> Term) they were promptly in attendance &amp;, anxious for trial; but the case was continued by the District Atto. (<persName ref="cwgk:N00002025">One son</persName> was not present, he having died lately.) They allege by affidavit that they have always been ready in the case &amp; they have been promptly at Court in every case, Except when the Recognizance was forfeited -- and then were absent for the reasons above stated. The amt. of the recognizance entered into by Mr W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Bowen &amp; Mr Stone, and which they ask to have remitted, was $500. for each of the alleged offenders.</p>
<p>W. Henry Holt says the statements above are true to the best of his knowledge &amp; belief.</p>
