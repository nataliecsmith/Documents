   <p>I was one of the jury that tried Henry Stallings for a breach of the peace before M. P. Heady in <date when="--09">September</date> last he was fined thirty dollars which I then thought and still think was grievously excessive, Stallings is a Union man, there were a good many secessionists on the jury &amp; it was political prejudice &amp; revenge that carried them to impose such a fine I am a Union man and thought it was better to let them impose that fine, than to have the jury and <unclear/> Stallings to more costs by another trial, believing that the Governor would relieve the larger portion of it the <date when="1863-10">Oct 1863</date> above facts are true.</p>
