<p>At the <date when="--12">Dec<hi rend="sup">r</hi></date> term of the <orgName ref="cwgk:O00000397">Henderson Circuit Court</orgName>, <persName ref="cwgk:N00000959">Benj Singleton </persName>was tried under the charge of grand larceny, &amp; the jury, failing to agree, he was bailed in the sum of $500 -- <persName ref="cwgk:N00000958">Milton Young</persName> dec<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">d</hi></hi> becoming his surety. He failed to appear at the <date when="1863-06">June term 1863</date>, in discharge of his bond, &amp; it was taken as forefeited.</p>
<p>Singleton, when indicted, was in <orgName ref="cwgk:O00001186">the Federal service</orgName>, having enlisted in <placeName ref="cwgk:P001818">Indiana</placeName>, of which state he was a citizen, &amp; was a mere boy. His witnesses were members of his regiment. &amp; during the court at which he was tried, were removed from this county to <placeName ref="cwgk:P001001">Tennessee</placeName>. On the trial a majority of the jury were in favor of his acquittal.</p>
<p>In Jany last, Milton Young, who became Singleton's surety from mere kindness -- died, whilst on his way to <placeName ref="cwgk:P00000308">Frankfort</placeName>, to attend the legislature, of which he was a member. a widow &amp; eleven children survive him, &amp; it will be a great hardship on them, if compelled to pay off this bond.</p>
<p>We think this a case that commends itself to your clemency, &amp; respectfully &amp; urgently entreat you to remit the forfeiture -- </p>
<p>Yr Obt Svts.

<p>The facts in this case are correctly set forth in this letter -- I think the case one in which the executive should interfere -- I therefore respectfully request your Excellency to grant the relief asked</p>
