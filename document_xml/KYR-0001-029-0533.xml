<p>He states that prior to the finding of said Indictment one Dr. Wit Beadles had from the County Court of Fulton County Ky obtained a license to keep a Tavern in said County which he did keep &amp; also kept a bar which he imployed your petitioner to keep, and for this he was indicted &amp; fined, &amp; when he came to make his defence, the same was <unclear/> out by the Court, upon the grounds that the Bar was not attached to the Tavern house,</p>
<p>He states that he &amp; Beadles had been informed &amp; so understood that under the recent laws of Kentucky, that it was not requisite that the Bar room &amp; Tavern house should be attached, &amp; such was the general understanding &amp; the opinion of some of the judges &amp; attornies &amp; relying upon this the Bar room was used as sugested &amp; in this way they <hi rend="str">at</hi> led into error &amp; have been fined, He states that he acted in good faith, not suspecting<pb/>
<lb/>that he was in the least violating any law wherefore he asks that said fine be released</p>
