<lb/>Hon. <persName ref="cwgk:N001000">Thos E. Bramlett</persName>,<lb/>Gov'r of <orgName ref="cwgk:O001025">Kentucky</orgName>.<lb/>Dear Sir;</p>
<p><persName ref="cwgk:N00004234">Joseph Henin</persName> and <persName ref="cwgk:N00004235">Charles Dupère</persName> are petitioning to you for a remission of two fines or forfeitures imposed on the former, who was the bail for a man named Paul Garis. I wrote a petition for the same party (Garis) a little more than a year ago, and your predecessor respited for a year that Garis might return and stand his trial, but he has not been heard of since. He doubtless is dead or was killed in the South somewhere, and in all probability before the forfeiture took place. Of this he can not know positively, for Henin has no means of knowing. I am informed by respectable parties that there was no merit in the cases, and that Garis would undoubtedly was innocent of the charges against him. <persName ref="cwgk:N00003057">Garis</persName> could not at any time have returned, and stood his trial. These two petitioners are poor men, and it will break them up <unclear>intenly</unclear> to be compelled to pay these executions.</p>
<p>Gen'l <persName ref="cwgk:N00002299">Rousseau</persName> was employed to defend for Garis, and<pb/>
<lb/>was well acquainted with all the facts connected with the whole case, and says that the whole affair is without merit. Henin has paid the 30 per cent already. Dupere has two sons now in the army and has had three until recently, and is a very poor and feeble old man.</p>
<p>I do hope you will be able to do something for them.</p>
<p>Your Very Respy
