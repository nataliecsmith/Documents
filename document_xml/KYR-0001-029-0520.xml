   <p>To His Excellency J A Robinson
<lb/>Governor of Kentucky:</p>
<p>As Magistrate in the City of Covington I tried the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky vs W<hi rend="sup">m</hi> Schmadde the driver or Agent of C, W, Roback, The proof showed that C, W, Roback had obtained a License <hi rend="str"><unclear/></hi>from the City of Covington and that the Dependant was his driver or Agent: this was proved by oral proof and by the License with an endorsement upon it. It also appeared that the License had issued to Mr Roback and not to the driver under the instructions of the Mayor of the City who issued it. As I<pb/>
<lb/>took the view that the License should have issued to the driver, I felt compelled to fine the Defendant $50 and costs. But as I am satisfied that the instructions of the Mayor led the Defendant into this difficulty, I believe it a case Justly claiming the Executive clemency, and Join in a prayer to have the fine remitted.</p>
