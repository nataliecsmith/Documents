<p>I as agent collected the rent of the House Nancy Allen lived in &amp; never saw nor heard of any Disorderly conduct about the house.</p>

<p>I most respectfully join in the above prayer of this coloured woman, being familiar with the facts I do not believe that the persecution was urged for the public-good, but merely to gratify private feeling.</p>

<p>Much personal ill feeling certainly existed against the petitioner Nancy Allan which was clearly manifested by the witesses for the Comlth. Judging from facts, which have been made known to me since the trial, are upon which I can rely. I respectfully suggest that Executive clemency will have been justly bestowed if the fine <hi rend="str">were</hi> be remitted</p>
<p>W. G. Reasor
<lb/>City atto</p>
<p>From the facts stated above by Mr Reasor from his personal knowledge I think that Executive clemency would be properly <unclear/> bestowed by remitting the fine</p>
