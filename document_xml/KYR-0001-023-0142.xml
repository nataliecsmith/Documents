   <p>Maj Chas Wickliffe</p>
<p>I have learned through the representations of Maj R. R. Willimas, Mr Lucien Anderson and others that Mr <gap/> Bolinger a citizen of Mayfield has been unlawfully seized and is now under arrest at Columbus, this is to request you to proceed to Columbus and request that he may be released by the parties who detain him And it being represented to me that his life would be in danger if he is released and left to proceed home unprotected, you will furnish him such a guard as may be necessary for his safe transit to his home or other place of safety</p>
