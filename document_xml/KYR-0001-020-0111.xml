   <p>Gov Magoffin
<lb/>Dear Sir</p>
<p>About twelve months since two citizens of Todd county Messrs Lauth and Dickerson -- brothers in law -- had a difficulty, which resulted in the interchange of hostile notes tending to an interview <hi rend="underline">across the Tennessee line</hi>. Before the meeting a reconciliation, perfectly satisfactory and honorable to both parties, was effected by the interposition of friends.</p>
<p>The grand jury of Todd -- not fancying such a correspondence -- took notice of it by indictment and the same is still pending. The friends of both gentlemen, and<pb/>
<lb/>they are numerous, apprehend that a trial of his case will possibly if not certainly renew the hostility heretofore existing, and, with a view to save so unpleasant a result, have determined to ask your intevention in behalf of the parties prior to a judgment.</p>
<p>From my knowledge of the parties, transaction and all the circumstance, I am altogether persuaded that the application is a meritorious one, and that your intervention will be highly satisfactory not only to your friends, but to the people of Todd and this county.</p>
<p>The parties are highly honorable gentlemen and will properly appreciate a favorable consideration of their case, and I feel satisfied that every body<pb/>
<lb/>will be pleased if you can intervene in their behalf -- </p>
<p>very truly
<lb/>Yr. Friend 
<lb/>H. J. Stites
